Explanation (initial filtering before all queries):
In order to get to top hospitals, a series of transformations needed to be done on the data.
 -> First, I filtered out any score data reading "Not Available"
 -> Next, I filtered out score data where sample size was not large enough (deemed any sample < 30 as potentially unreliable and filtered out)
 -> Subsequently, I noticed that many of the scores were not actually denominated out of 100; many of these instead were wait times or other factors not set on a consistent scale
   -> As such, I filtered these non-100 based scores out of tables
 -> Then, I created temporary consolidated joined table (called "effective_care_filtered_joined2") through a series of steps to create a consistent baseline to analyze off of
   -> This table included joined state and survey data
All of the above were done in the "transforming" steps and are saved within that folder.

CORRELATION OF SURVEY RESPONSES with 1) AVERAGE PROCEDURE SCORE and 2) VARIABILITY OF PROCEDURE SCORE within hospitals EXPLANATION AND OUTPUT:

Conclusions:
A higher HCAHPS survey score has a material positive correlation (corr value=0.165) with higher average process/procedure score for that hospital.
A higher HCAHPS survey score also has a material negative correlation (corr value=-0.184) with variability of process/procedure scores within a hospital.
As such, a higher HCAHPS score is indicative


Approach: Create new temporary table based on correlation queries grouping by provider_id and hospital_name. This table groups average score, stddev of scores, and hcahps average score
From here, use a SQL correlation query to see if there are material positive or negative correlations.
Expectation would be that there is a positive correlation with avg score and hcahps_base_score as well as zero or negative correlation with variability of scores and hcahps_base_score.
 -> This turned out to be the case with a positive correlation to avg score and a negative correlation to variability of procedural scores

Explanation of Table Creation/Queres: 
--Create table allowing for easy correlation queries grouping by provider_id and hospital_name, and bringing in average score by hospital, variability of procedure score by hospital, and hcahps_survey_score by hospital
CREATE TABLE for_correlations as SELECT 
provider_id, hospital_name, AVG(score) as score_avg, STDDEV(score) as score_stddev, COUNT(score) as score_count, AVG(hcahps_base_score) as hcahps_base_score
FROM effective_care_filtered_joined2
GROUP BY provider_id, hospital_name
HAVING COUNT(score) >= 10
ORDER BY score_avg DESC
;

--Query correlations off of this created table
SELECT corr(score_avg, hcahps_base_score) FROM for_correlations;
SELECT corr(score_stddev, hcahps_base_score) FROM for_correlations;
