Explanation (initial filtering before all queries):
In order to get to top hospitals, a series of transformations needed to be done on the data.
 -> First, I filtered out any score data reading "Not Available"
 -> Next, I filtered out score data where sample size was not large enough (deemed any sample < 30 as potentially unreliable and filtered out)
 -> Subsequently, I noticed that many of the scores were not actually denominated out of 100; many of these instead were wait times or other factors not set on a consistent scale
   -> As such, I filtered these non-100 based scores out of tables
 -> Then, I created temporary consolidated joined table (called "effective_care_filtered_joined2") through a series of steps to create a consistent baseline to analyze off of
   -> This table included joined state and survey data
All of the above were done in the "transforming" steps and are saved within that folder.

HIGHEST VARIABILITY PROCEDURES AND PROCESSES SPECIFIC EXPLANATION AND OUTPUT:

TOP-10 HIGHEST VARIABILITY CHOSEN: (Head CT results,
Thrombolytic Therapy, 
Warfarin therapy discharge instructions, 
Healthcare workers given influenza vaccination, 
Stroke Education, 
Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis, 
Home Management Plan of Care Document, 
Immunization for influenza, 
Discharge instructions, 
ICU venous thromboembolism prophylaxis)


Approach: Get to top-10 most variable processes/procedures based on standard deviation of score across hospitals. Query just on top-10 (no buffer) as this is a measure of variability, so can just get highest stddevs as the best representation here (no need to filter out values).
This approach is appropriate because it filters out noisy data (in filtering before queries) to ensure using scores with large enough sample size and also to ensure using scores with same denominators out of 100.
Sample sizes per process/procedure are relatively, increasing our confidence in the output.
Standard deviation here is a great measurement for variability; no need to get any fancier with unit of variability measurement.

Explanation of Query: Query standard deviations by process/procedure as long as there are 10+ instances of scores, group by measure_id and measure_name.

SQL Query:
SELECT measure_id, measure_name, AVG(score) as score_avg, STDDEV(score) as score_stddev, COUNT(score) as score_count 
FROM effective_care_filtered_joined2
GROUP BY measure_id, measure_name
HAVING COUNT(score) >= 5
ORDER BY score_stddev DESC
LIMIT 10
;

SQL Output: (measure_id, measure_name, score, score_stddev, score_count)
